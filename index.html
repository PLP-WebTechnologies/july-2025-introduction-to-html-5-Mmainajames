        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          In recent years, Kenya has witnessed a powerful shift in youth engagement, led by Generation Z. This revolution isn't just online—it's in the streets, on the ballots, and in the nation's consciousness. With digital fluency, political awareness, and a demand for accountability, Gen-Z is redefining civic participation.

        <h2>Causes of the Movement</h2>
        <p>
          Several factors have fueled this uprising: rising unemployment, political disillusionment, corruption, and a deep desire for structural change. Gen-Z has mobilized through social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and Instagram to raise awareness, organize protests, and influence policy discussions.

        <h2>Impact and Influence</h2>
        <p>
          From peaceful demonstrations to viral campaigns, Gen-Z has challenged outdated systems and demanded representation. Their efforts have led to government responses, legal reforms, and a shift in public discourse. The movement has also inspired solidarity among older generations and global observers.

        <h2>The Future of Gen-Z Activism</h2>
        <p>
          With increasing digital tools, political awareness, and unity, the Gen-Z revolution shows no signs of slowing down. The movement is likely to influence the 2027 elections, reshape public institutions, and solidify a culture of transparency, inclusivity, and accountability in Kenya.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The Gen-Z revolution in Kenya is more than a passing moment—it's a generational call to action. As youth continue to amplify their voices, they are not only shaping the nation’s future but also rewriting the narrative of African youth power.
